Between our first class and the class on the 15th of October

I haven’t been doing all that much apart from building some sort of idea for what I want to base my essay in. 

1. I’ve been trying to find a topic that I can closely relate to my Music Project seminar next term.  
2. I’ve been trying a direction I am more certain I will want to learn about in a few months and maybe even through the next academic year. 

Context 

My passions since starting to study music technology have been pretty similar the whole way though. I started in college working on surround sound/ sound design. I was building an octophonic speaker essay and in the box creating some sort of sound image or space. I’ve been doing similar work since. My first year of uni I developed a tool to allow entry level users to create soundscapes with a PD patch, my second year I developed a system to allow people to create soundscapes with body movement with use of Max/MSP and the Microsoft Kinect. My third year (abroad) I worked with a laptop orchestra finally creating my own piece using again an octophonic array and some some sort of soundscape. 

Goal 

This year I am going to try and build something I am personally proud of an in doing so I aim to use this module to do my research for it’s creating. The ‘it’ is still in question but Im striating to think something along the lines of a laptop orchestra that creates sound spaces with multiple players. 

Research

In the last day I’ve read through a few introductory articles and papers on laptop orchestras and the way they might work. All papers are somewhat related to PLOrk (Prinston’s laptop orchestra) and therefor Ge Want, Perry Cook and others. 

Aims for the moment 

At the moment I’m aiming to get to grasp with the concept of creating the laptop orchestra format to a level in which I can manipulate it for my own use without recreating the wheel. 

Week 4/5 (Reading Week) 

Most of the papers I had read previously where based on the PLOrk standard of laptop orchestration. I’ve been trying to branch out a little more and find some more sources on the construction of separate elements within the Orchestra including controllers, systems but also on the politics found within a laptop Orchestra. I’ve been trying to narrow down my critical approach to this essay by talking to both Chris and Danny about this topic. I believe some angles I can take are along the lines of how the controller might effect the outcome unwillingly. I also want to home in on the definition of a laptop orchestra and how far we can push that model; What similarities do we have between conventional orchestration and laptop orchestras; Is the laptop orchestra an evolution of the classical that might take us further using new technologies. These are just a few of the ideas but I will see where I can take it.
